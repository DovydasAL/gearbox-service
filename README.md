# Shift Redeeming Service

This windows service is designed to scrape Gearboxes twitter at [dgSHiFTCodesBL3](https://twitter.com/dgSHiFTCodesBL3) and automatically submit the codes to Gearboxes website. Currently, this will only work for this twitter account, but it is configurable. It is not recommended to not use the non-BL3 account, as the behavior may not work.
